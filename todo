FIXES:
- find out when the API quota is a problem with api_scrape.py, and make sure it raises an exception when it is (low priority)


ADDITIONS:
scrape_since_publish.py:
- when missing hourly data, get data from since_published view (probably actually do this when visualizing, because it's saved anyway)

in the end we want to A/B test thumbnails or titles so in that case we'd want minute-data from ~30 minutes before switching to maybe a bit longer after.
we want to do this switch at a busy time when it's getting views of course, to get the most data, and 
    for this kind of testing it's important to know the influence of other factors like time of day, day of week and whether a new video is uploaded,
    to avoid these effects muddying the results. One option is to avoid these factors by trying to keep them constant, another way is to predict their effect.
        Try this effect predicting regardless, be interesting to train a simple AI model even if it's not accurate enough to use for the A/B testing.
    Clearest would be to have two identical videos with two different thumbnails/titles and then switch them
    at any time so that both options are always up, but this is kinda stupid of course because you're dividing the views across two videos.. worth a try?
    For older videos, they probably aren't getting many views anymore so the test might take longer to execute to get sufficient data.
it's important to have a robust system of saving the correct analytics with the correct versions of title and thumbnail
