FIXES:
- found out when the API quota is a problem with api_scrape.py, and make sure it raises an exception when it is


ADDITIONS:
scrape_since_publish.py:
- when video datetime is not precise in the video log, get precise datetime from 24h view
- when missing hourly data, get data from since_published view (probably actually do this when visualizing, because it's saved anyway)
log_videos.py:
- add logged videos with imprecise datetime to video ids to scrape
