FIXES:
- found out when the API quota is a problem with api_scrape.py, and make sure it raises an exception when it is (low priority)


ADDITIONS:
scrape_since_publish.py:
- when missing hourly data, get data from since_published view (probably actually do this when visualizing, because it's saved anyway)
